# MIDDLEWARE

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your application middleware.
Middleware let you define custom functions that can be run before rendering either a page or a group of pages.

By default, middleware in NuxtJS is also exposed to the client side. This is useful for common middleware like auth where you need to ensure that a token is set in the local storage or cookie for a user to ensure they are authenticated.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing#middleware).
